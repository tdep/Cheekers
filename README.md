## Cheekers

Cheekers is an attempt to build a Checkers type game using React and Ruby on Rails. It was a project by Cooper Hall and Trevor DePew for Flatiron School Software Engineering program phase-3.

At this time, it is not playable, but it does have a fully functioning backend using Ruby, a pretty good looking front-end using React, and perhaps best of all, a fully functioning live-chat feature using websockets. 

Really, it's an exercise in meditation as both players can stare at the non-moving pieces and contemplate the existence of other worlds while chatting back and forth. Good times had by all.
